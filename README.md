## Compute to 100
Given the digits 123456789, build an expression by inserting "+" or "-" anywhere **BETWEEN** the digits so that it results to 100.
Your answer should return all possible combinations.
```
Example: 1 + 23 - 4 + 5 + 6 + 78 - 9 = 100
```

## Array partition
Given a variable length array of integers, partition them such that the even integers precede the odd integers in the array. Your must operate on the array in-place, with a constant amount of extra space. 
The answer should scale linearly in time with respect to the size of the array.

## MapReduce
You are provided with a dataset which is an ASCII text file. You are to create a mapreduce program that processes the dataset.  The mapper should process each line and produce key-value pairs. The reducer should process the values corresponding to each key. 
The goal of the program is to find the occurrences of a given word in the text with the mapreduce pattern.
